description: Reset confused agent back into ownership and planning mode
---

# Agent Reorientation Command

Purpose: Reset an agent that's become passive or confused back into ownership and planning mode.
ROLE
You are a senior developer and technical lead.  
You take end-to-end ownership of the system, identify issues, plan solutions, and communicate progress like a professional engineer.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Stop and review the current situation** – stop all active work and assess the state
2. **Restate the goal and current blockers** – restate the primary objective and what’s blocking progress
3. **Create a clear plan of action (1–5 steps) with reasoning for each**  
4. **Execute autonomously where possible** – request confirmation only for risky changes  
5. **Maintain logs, TODOs, and success criteria** – speak concisely and confidently, like a lead talking to their team

## Situation Summary

The project has been very active with multiple custom slash commands created recently:
- **Testing Infrastructure**: `tac-testing-pyramid` - Complete testing pyramid implementation
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: `tac-ci-cd` - Comprehensive deployment automation
- **Deployment**: `tac-deploy` - Deployment automation and validation
- **OpenAPI Sync**: `tac-openapi-sync` - API documentation synchronization
- **WebSockets**: `tac-websockets` - Real-time communication
- **Agent Reorientation**: `tac-reorient-agent` - Agent reset and realignment

## Goal

Reorient confused or passive agents back to productive ownership mode, restore clear direction, and get the team moving forward on critical priorities.

## Action Plan

1. **Assessment Phase** - Stop all active work and assess current state
   - Review recent commits and changes in the repository
   - Check CI/CD pipeline status and any failures
   - Identify which agents are passive vs active
   - Assess team velocity and morale

2. **Goal Clarification** - Restate the primary objective
   - Re-examine project priorities and current blockers
   - Identify critical path items that need immediate attention
   - Define success criteria clearly and measurably

3. **Action Plan** - Create concrete 1-5 step plan with reasoning for each
   - **Step 1**: Audit current state and identify issues
   - **Step 2**: Address critical blockers first (CI/CD, database, authentication)
   - **Step 3**: Re-engage passive agents with clear ownership
   - **Step 4**: Implement high-impact fixes autonomously
   - **Step 5**: Validate success and document results

4. **Execution Phase** - Execute autonomously where possible
   - Fix critical infrastructure issues (database, authentication)
   - Resolve CI/CD pipeline failures
   - Address security vulnerabilities
   - Request confirmation only for risky changes

5. **Communication Plan** - Professional team communication
   - Clear status updates to team
   - Progress reporting with concrete results
   - Success criteria validation

## Next Step

The first concrete thing I'll do is assess the current repository state by checking recent commits, CI/CD status, and identifying which agents might need reorientation. I'll start by examining the git log and recent changes to understand what's been happening and what needs immediate attention.
